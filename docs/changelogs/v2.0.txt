# MadMilkman.Ini Version 2.0

The main purpose of this version is to migrate the project to .NET Standard 2.0, which is a breaking change and as such required the major version to be increased. **This version doesn't work with .NET Framework versions that don't support .NET Standard 2.0.** All the CSProj/VBProj files were upgraded to .NET Framework 4.8 so they should continue to work, though I didn't touch the C++ projects as VS2019 said the correct program wasn't found and I didn't want to mess with it. Aside from that, I also deleted the MSI and ZIP files containing the library from the source.
